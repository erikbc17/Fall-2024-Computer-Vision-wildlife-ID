# Wildlife safety project
The goal of this project is to create a real life object detection, identification, and threat assessment for child safety monitoring in outdoor settings

From stranger danger to wild animals or poisonous plants, this project is to create an enclosed neural network model that provides assessment of objects in a user's vicinity to detect dangers you may not see with the naked eye.
  Initial Implementation will be in detecting wildlife such as mountain lion, bears, wolves, and foxes & provide a threat assessment based on movement & proximity.
